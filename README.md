Not really intended for others use but you can if you want.

If any method looks pointless its likely there to make something existing easier to remember, faster to type or have a more unique signature to make it auto complete faster. 

The event priority system is intended for projects not intended to be fully compatable with other mods, it's basically a more complicated form of having a single method that susbscribes to an event that manually calls your methods in order (except this system allows addons to insert themselves into their correct place on the list)
